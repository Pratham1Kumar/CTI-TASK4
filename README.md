DESCRIPTION OF TASK:

Designing a framework to ensure security and compliance for a big data system (e.g., ensuring compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) requires a structured approach that addresses both technical and organizational requirements. The framework must integrate security controls, data governance, and privacy measures while aligning with relevant regulations. Below is a high-level framework designed to ensure security and compliance in a big data system:
1. Data Governance and Classification
Data Classification:
Personal Data: Identify data that is considered personal or sensitive (e.g., personally identifiable information, health data). For GDPR, this would include data such as name, email, address, health records, etc.
Sensitive Data: Separate personal data from other types of sensitive data, such as payment information, social security numbers, or medical records for HIPAA compliance.
Data Labeling:
Use labels to clearly mark datasets as confidential, regulated, or restricted based on the data's nature. This helps enforce rules for access control, encryption, and auditing.
Data Retention and Disposal:
Implement data retention policies ensuring that data is kept for no longer than required by regulations (e.g., GDPR's "right to be forgotten").
Define secure data disposal methods (e.g., data wiping or physical destruction of storage devices).
2. Access Control and Identity Management
Authentication:
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for users accessing sensitive or personal data.
Single Sign-On (SSO): Implement an SSO system for centralizing and simplifying user management while ensuring robust access control.
Authorization:
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define roles with specific access permissions to control who can read, write, and modify datasets. For example:
Data engineers can modify raw data.
Analysts can view aggregated data but not modify or access personal data.
Admins should have elevated access but should be restricted from accessing sensitive personal data without clear use cases.
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Where needed, implement ABAC to apply more granular policies based on attributes (e.g., department, location, etc.).
Privileged Access Management (PAM):
Implement controls for privileged users (admins, system operators) to ensure their access is properly logged and limited. Use just-in-time access (JIT) to limit the time that privileged access is granted.
3. Encryption and Data Masking
Encryption:
At Rest: Ensure that sensitive data stored in databases or distributed systems is encrypted using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256).
In Transit: Encrypt data in transit using secure protocols like TLS/SSL to prevent unauthorized interception (e.g., when data is transmitted between services or to/from users).
End-to-End Encryption: For highly sensitive data (e.g., healthcare records under HIPAA), consider encrypting the data end-to-end, ensuring only authorized parties can decrypt and access it.
Data Masking:
Mask data when it is being used in non-production environments or in analytics tools where full access is not required. For example, display only the last four digits of a social security number for reporting.
4. Audit and Monitoring
Logging:
Audit Logs: Enable logging of all access, modifications, and data usage events, including user identities, timestamps, and the data accessed. These logs should be immutable and centrally stored for easy access.
Transaction Logs: Record all data modification transactions, including updates and deletions, to ensure there is an audit trail for compliance (e.g., GDPRâ€™s accountability principle).
Real-Time Monitoring:
Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to monitor logs in real-time for suspicious activity (e.g., unauthorized access or abnormal queries).
Implement anomaly detection using machine learning models or predefined thresholds to flag abnormal behavior, such as data exfiltration or mass downloads of sensitive data.
Compliance Reporting:
Generate periodic reports (e.g., quarterly or yearly) to demonstrate compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR audit reports, HIPAA breach reporting). These reports should include details about access control violations, audit trail review, and any data breaches.
5. Data Minimization and Anonymization
Data Minimization:
Only collect the minimum necessary data for the purpose at hand. For example, under GDPR, only collect data that is directly needed for the specific use case and avoid storing data "just in case."
Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization:
Anonymization: Remove personally identifiable information (PII) to ensure that data cannot be traced back to an individual. This is critical for compliance with GDPR, which requires anonymization where possible.
Pseudonymization: Consider pseudonymizing sensitive data where possible, such as replacing identifiable names with pseudonyms while retaining certain data relationships.
6. Compliance with Regulations (GDPR, HIPAA)
GDPR Compliance:
Data Subject Rights: Implement features to allow users to access, correct, and delete their data as required by GDPR.
Right to Access: Users should be able to request a copy of the data you have stored about them.
Right to Rectification: Users can request corrections to inaccurate data.
Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten): Ensure processes are in place for users to request data deletion.
Data Breach Notification: Implement processes to detect, respond to, and notify regulators and affected individuals within the 72-hour period required by GDPR in case of a data breach.
Data Processing Agreement (DPA): Ensure contracts with third-party data processors (e.g., cloud providers, analytics vendors) comply with GDPR requirements.
HIPAA Compliance:
Data Encryption: Encrypt health data both at rest and in transit to comply with HIPAA's confidentiality requirements.
Access Controls: Ensure strict access control policies are in place to ensure only authorized personnel can access protected health information (PHI).
Business Associate Agreements (BAA): Ensure contracts with third parties who handle PHI (e.g., cloud providers, IT contractors) include HIPAA-compliant Business Associate Agreements.
7. Incident Response and Disaster Recovery
Incident Response Plan:
Develop and document an incident response plan that specifies procedures for identifying, responding to, and mitigating security breaches, with specific guidelines for handling personal or sensitive data breaches.
Ensure that response teams are trained on the legal and regulatory obligations for breach notification under GDPR, HIPAA, or other relevant laws.
Disaster Recovery Plan:
Define a disaster recovery plan to ensure the continuity of services. This includes regular backups of critical data and ensuring those backups are encrypted and compliant with data retention policies.
Implement geo-redundancy for data storage to ensure data availability and durability in the event of an outage.
8. Third-Party Risk Management
Third-Party Audits:
Ensure that all third-party vendors and service providers (e.g., cloud storage providers, analytics platforms) are compliant with the relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA). This may require regular security audits or certifications such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2.
Data Processing Agreements (DPA): Have a DPA in place with all third-party vendors that outlines data handling responsibilities and ensures they adhere to compliance requirements.
